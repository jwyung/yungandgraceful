                Jonathan Yung and Grace Jia. Many have asked us about how we know we're right for each other. Maybe it's the way we push each other beyond our comfort zones, beyond our limits to find our better selves. But sometimes, we think it's how Grace prefers to cook while Jonathan prefers to eat. Or maybe, it's the depth of our relationship that we can hear, comprehend, and feel each others' silent thoughts.

                        Perhaps it's how we set, achieve, and celebrate life goals. We may have different methods of achieving those goals, but we both want the same end result.
